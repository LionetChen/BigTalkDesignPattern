Set migration project (where to put the migration files) by going into its folder:
cd .\RP.DataAccess.EFCore

* optionally by settings MigrationsAssembly in Program.cs
    services.AddDbContext<ApplicationContext>(options =>
    options.UseSqlServer(
        Configuration.GetConnectionString("DefaultConnection"),
        b => b.MigrationsAssembly(typeof(ApplicationDbContext).Assembly.FullName)));

Set target project by select Default project in Pckage Manager Console:
RP.DataAccess.EFCore

These two needs to match. Then we can 
Add-Migration
